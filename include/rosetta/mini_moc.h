//
// A header-only, moc-less reimagining of Qt's signals / slots / properties on
// top of C++26 reflection (P2996) + annotations (P3394).
//
// Requires a toolchain with reflection + annotation-attributes. Tested with the
// Bloomberg clang-p2996 fork.
//
// Notes vs. real Qt:
//  * Token injection (P3294) isn't in clang-p2996 yet, so we cannot auto-emit
//    `name()/setName()` accessors into the class body. Instead, callers reach
//    properties through `get<"name">(obj)` / `set<"name">(obj, v)` — same
//    semantics (equality-gated, fires NOTIFY), just outside the class.
//  * `connect<"sig","slot">(sender, receiver)` is compile-time-checked:
//    wrong name -> static_assert, wrong arg types -> template error.
//
// What you use:
//  * Annotations  : slot, property{...}            (mark members)
//  * Free funcs   : connect<...>, get<...>, set<...>
// A signal needs NO annotation: any `Signal<Args...>` data member IS a signal,
// recognized by its type via reflection. You never call its methods directly —
// connect through connect<>, and emission happens when set<> fires a property's
// NOTIFY. The Signal<...> machinery and the ScopedConnection RAII handle are
// treated as implementation detail and defined in inline/mini_moc.hxx, not here.
//
// See tests/moc.cpp

     * linkage, so we route the string literals through define_static_string to ensure they meet
     * that requirement. The view() method provides a convenient way to get a std::string_view of
     * the fixed_string, which is what the rest of the code uses for comparisons and lookups. We
     * also define an equality operator for fixed_string to allow for easy comparison in
     * static_asserts and other compile-time checks.
     * Note that fixed_string is a simple wrapper around a char array, and it doesn't manage memory
     * or provide any dynamic features. It's purely a compile-time utility for working with string
     * literals in the context of annotations and NTTPs.
